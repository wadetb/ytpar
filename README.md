# YTPAR (YouTube Parent/Party)

[Firefox Add-on Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ytpar/)

YTPAR is a browser extension for parents who want to monitor their child's YouTube activity.

It watches for changes to the page title on YouTube.com and posts updates to an endpoint of your choice (e.g., a Discord Webhook).

The extension name is also an anagram of PARTYâ€”because why not!
